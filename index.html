    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Eimy Rodriguez. I'm a Junior in high school with a current GPA of 3.7. I’ve been in a couple of Ap and Honors <br/>classes so far in my high school years, classes like Ap Government, Spanish 3 H, and now I’m doing Algebra II H, Ap Language, and Spanish 4 H.<br/> Since little I been wanting to be a little bit of everything, always changing careers like tooth brushes. But I never visualize myself doing those things,<br/> except for flight attendant, I was very into it until I started doing research about it. It wasn’t until a year ago I decide to commit to a Computer Science major,<br/> though Im still thinking what career specifically fits me best, but I believe as time progresses I’ll figure it out. I love coding, including the hard days when nothing makes sense because <br/>that’s when passion starts to kick in. I have no idea what it’s ahead of me but that’s what I aspire to find out, this passion that God has placed in my heart, or so I believe,<br/> is a blessing because the things I’ve learned so far has expanded my thinking and knowledge to an extend since I have so much more to learn and discover. I want to be someone in life <br/>and make life mean something, and for that reason I’ll take whatever opportunity to become that someone. </p>
